Some information about you!

### Hi! My name’s Daniel. I’m 18 years old. I’m currently on a gap year, so I decided to write a blog about my life and other things. Click here to watch the video that motivated me to start a blog. The things that I have the most passion for are traveling, languages, food and games. I’ll be writing about all of these things. My current goal is to have a location independent job such as a freelancer or getting my incomes through this blog or my YouTube channel. My dream is to travel the world, try different foods and meet the most amazing people I can in my life time. I am living in Seoul, South Korea but I wish to move to Frankfurt, Germany. Anyways, hope you enjoy my blog posts and have an amazing day 

A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
